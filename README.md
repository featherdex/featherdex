# FeatherDeX Desktop Trading Application

This desktop application allows you to trade on the Omnifeather decentralized exchange that runs on the Feathercoin blockchain. For more information on Omnifeather, visit https://omnifeather.com/ or its GitHub site https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnifeather.

## How to Use

Before starting this application, make sure you run the Omnifeather client/wallet.

If your wallet is not in a standard location, you will have to open the settings in the app and select the Omnifeather conf file (`feathercoin.conf`).

Once you have started the client and it is up to date, you may start the application.

## How to Build

Must have Node.js, preferably v14 LTS. Must also have Typescript! Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/featherdex/featherdex.git
cd featherdex
```

```bash
npm i
npm run deliver
```

The built binaries should be in `./dist/[PLATFORM]/`.
